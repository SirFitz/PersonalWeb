	<p class="ap1"> Welcome To Our Site! My name's Romario, 
		you may be wondering why I'd make this this,
	 	there are so many other tech sites out there!
	 	Well here's why, the thing is alot, most,
	 	if not <b>all</b> of these sites have incorrect information on them.
	 	Whether they be popular or unknown. I'm here to give you 
	 	unbiased and correct information. I hope you enjoy my site!
	 </p>
	 <p class="ap2"> This site will also contain content which I have created,
	 	Youtube video's which I have been granted permission to use, tutorials,
	 	etc. </p>
