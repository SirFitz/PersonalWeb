	<p>Intel Processor Guide 

There are a number of processor brands currently under the intel banner, namely 

Atom, Core M, Celeron, Pentium, Core i3, Core i5, Core i7 and Xeon 
There are also many variations within these product lines, each product line also has a particular market.
I’ll start things off simple 

Families

Atom – Small devices, netbooks, phones, Chromebooks
Core M – Netbooks, Chromebooks, low powered laptops
Celeron – Budget entry level laptops, notebooks, netbooks, low powered desktops
Pentium – Slightly more powerful low end laptops, low powered desktops
Core i3 – Entry level performance laptops and desktops, respectable performance 
Core i5 – Laptop – Generally slightly higher spec’d i3’s, with a few exceptions 
 	   Desktop – Mid to low-high end Systems with very good performance 
Core i7 – The highest end consumer grade intel processors, these are the most powerful processors you		   will find from intel on the consumer side, they outclass any other consumer grade processor 		   on the market from any brand. 
Xeon – Server and workstation processors, certified for 24/7 operation

Naming Scheme
 



Generations

Within intel’s families of processors there are different “generations” representing different processor architectures, rather than having a completely different naming scheme each year intel chooses to approach the naming scheme in this manner. This article deals with intel processors, from the Nehalem architecture onwards within this line up intel introduced the Core I series of processors, seeing as these would be the most popular consumer grade processors, this guide will show you how to differentiate between the different generations 

Generation 1 – Nehalem, introduced in 2010, these processors have a 3-digit naming scheme: 
Core i3 -540 
Core i5 – 760 
Core i7 – 930

Generation 2 – Sandy Bridge, introduced in 2011, these processors have a 4-digit naming scheme, beginning with the number 2, i.e. the number in the 2 thousands:
Core i3 - 2100
Core i5 – 2500
Core i7 – 2600K

Generation 3 – Ivy Bridge, introduced in 2012, these processors have a 4-digit naming scheme, beginning with the number 3, i.e. the number in the 3 thousands:
Core i3 - 3120
Core i5 – 3570K
Core i7 – 3770T

Generation 4 – Haswell, introduced in 2013, these processors have a 4-digit naming scheme, beginning with the number 4, i.e. the number in the 4 thousand:
Core i3 – 4130T
Core i5 – 4690K
Core i7 – 4770

Generation 5 – Broadwell, introduced in 2015, these processors have a 4-digit naming scheme, beginning with the number 5, i.e. the number in the 5 thousands:
There are no fifth generation Core i3 desktop processors
Core i3 – 5005U
Core i5 – 5675C
Core i7 – 5775R

Generation 6 – Ivy Bridge, introduced in 2015, these processors have a 4-digit naming scheme, beginning with the number 6, i.e. the number in the 6 thousands:
Core i3 – 6300P
Core i5 – 6500
Core i7 – 6700















Still on intel’s naming scheme the more acute of you may have noticed that some of these processors names ended with letters whereas some did not, these letters do have significance, their meanings are listed below 

Letter	Meaning	Generation	Platform
C	Unlocked processor with high performance graphics	5	Desktop
H	High Performance Graphics	4,5,6	Mobile
HK	High performance Graphics, Unlocked processor	6	Mobile
HQ	High Performance Graphics, Quad Core	4,5,6	Mobile
K	Unlocked processor	2,3,4,6	Desktop
M	Mobile processor	2,3,	Mobile
MQ	Mobile Quad Core 	4	Mobile
MX	Mobile Extreme Edition	4	Mobile
QM	Quad Core Mobile	2,3	Mobile
R	Desktop processor based on mobile sock with high performance graphics	4,5	Desktop
T	Power-optimized lifestyle 	2,3,4,6	Desktop
U	Ultra-low power	3,4,5,6	Mobile
X	Extreme edition	1,2,3,4,5,6	Desktop
Y	Extremely low power	3,4	Mobile
S	Performance-optimized lifestyle	2,3,4	Desktop

Extreme Editions:

 Now that we’ve been through all that, here’s a bit of a tricky part. They do not all have an X at the end, only the highest end extreme editions do. All desktop extreme edition processors with the exception of generation 1, start with the number of the next generation, for example, the i7-3820 is a second generation extreme edition processor, another way of identifying an extreme edition processor is to look at the second number in the sequence, if it is equal to or greater than 8, then the processor is an extreme edition.



Processor Cycles:

Intel’s Tick Tock Sequence represents a change in architecture and a change in processor manufacturing technology. Each "tick" represents a shrinking of the process technology of the previous microarchitecture and each "tock" represents a new microarchitecture. Usually every year to 18 months, there is expected to be one tick or tock. However, in 2014 Intel broke this time cycle due to the expanding times to the next tick. 


Note: This article holds an emphasis on consumer grade parts, particularly the Core I series, the other series, like the Xeon, have an entirely different naming schemes, even their own families, such as Xeon E3, E5 and E7, if you would like a guide on Xeon processors as well, simply let me know at email: example@example.com

	<h3>AMD Processor Guide</h3>
Similarly, to the Intel Processor Guide, this AMD guide will only be dealing with the current brands of AMD processors

Sempron, Athlon, A4, A6, A8, A10, FX and Opteron

There are a few things one needs to know before learning about AMD processors, as they are much more confusing than intel processors, with regards to naming that is:
APU - Accelerated Processing Unit, this is what AMD calls their microprocessors which have integrated graphics built in.
GPU – Graphics Processing Unit, these deal with generating images to be displayed on the screen
Compute Cores – These can either be, CPU cores or GPU cores.

Families
E1 – Dual Core low end amd APU’s, one of the weakest integrated graphics
E2 – Quad Core low end amd APU’s, the weakest integrated graphics
Sempron – These are the lowest end amd processors they are APU’s
Athlon – These may or may not contain integrated graphics, they are either dual or quad core parts
A4 – 1MB cache these are dual and quad core parts with the weakest integrated graphics in AMD’s		product stack, however are still competitive with intel’s implementation
A6 – these are quad core parts with more powerful integrated graphics with respect to the A4’s, 1-4MB		cache
A8 – these are quad core parts with even more powerful integrated graphics units, 4MB cache
A10 –   At the top of the APU line up sits the A10 APU’s, they are the most powerful AMD APU’s with the		highest end integrated graphics, so much so that they are used for budget gaming systems.		Quad Cores
FX Series – 4-8 Cores – these are pure multicore cpu, with no integrated graphics and are generally at		     highest end of AMD’s product line
Opteron – These are server grade AMD Processors
Specifications

Laptops

E1-Series – Dual Core, 1MB Cache, low power
E2-Series – Quad Core, 2MB Cache, low power, with the exception of 1 model which has similar specs to		       an E1 processor (E2-3000)
A4-Series – Quad Core, 2MB Cache, 4-5 Compute Cores
A6-Series – Quad Core, 1-2MB Cache, 5-6 Compute Cores
A8-Series – Quad Core, 2-4MB Cache, 8-10 Compute Cores
A10- Series – Quad Core, 2-4MB Cache, 10 Compute Cores
FX- Series – Quad Core, 2-4MB Cache, 10-12 Compute Cores

Desktops

Sempron- Series – 2-4 Cores, 1-2MB Cache
Athlon APU- Series – 4 Cores, 2MB Cache
Athlon CPU- Series – 4 Cores, 4MB Cache
A4-Series – Quad Core, 1-2MB Cache, 4-5 Compute Cores
A6-Series – Quad Core, 1-2MB Cache, 5-6 Compute Cores
A8-Series – Quad Core, 2-4MB Cache, 8-10 Compute Cores
A10- Series – Quad Core, 4MB Cache, 12 Compute Cores
FX- Series – 4-8 cores, 4-8MB Cache
Opteron – 4-16 cores, 4-12MB Cache


Naming Scheme
An easy way to try to determine the specifications of AMD processors is:
Series	Number of CPU cores	Model Number
FX	8	350


HOWEVER, AMD has long strayed far from this conventional naming scheme and has released so many oddly named processors that there is no clear way to decipher the specifications short of searching for the EXACT name of the processing unit.

Note:	 All FX series CPU’s are unlocked
All CPU’s ending with a “K” are unlocked
